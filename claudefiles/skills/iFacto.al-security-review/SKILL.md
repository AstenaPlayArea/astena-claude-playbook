description: 'Review AL code for BC-specific security risks (SecretText, IsolatedStorage, permissions, DataClassification, HttpClient, injection, telemetry, startup hooks). Has three modes — design (proactive threat model), code (inline guidance while writing), review (pass/fail audit of finished code). Use from iFacto.SolutionDesigner, iFacto.ALCoder, and iFacto.CodeReviewer.'

# AL Security Review

## When to Use

Invoke this skill whenever the work touches a security-sensitive AL primitive — credentials, permissions, web services, PII, telemetry — or whenever a security-focused review is requested.

Trigger constructs include: `SecretText`, `IsolatedStorage`, `HttpClient`, `permissionset`, `entitlement`, `InherentPermissions`, `InherentEntitlements`, `DataClassification`, `SetFilter` with user input, `Session.LogMessage`, `FeatureTelemetry`, `OnCompanyOpen`, install/upgrade codeunits, API pages, SOAP/OData exposure.

## Standards Source

All three modes evaluate against the **security knowledge in the installed BCQuality
knowledge base** (locate it per the `iFacto.company-guidelines` skill, Step 1):

- `custom/knowledge/security/` — iFacto-specific security rules (this domain is still being
  populated — migration "fase 2"; enumerate whatever exists, never assume it's empty or full)
- `microsoft/knowledge/security/` and `microsoft/knowledge/privacy/` — the BC platform
  security rules (SecretText, IsolatedStorage scopes, inherent permissions,
  DataClassification, HttpClient, injection, telemetry hygiene, ...)

The findings are organized under the **seven iFacto security categories** (this framework is
owned by this skill): (1) secrets & credentials, (2) permissions & entitlements, (3) data
classification, (4) external communication, (5) injection & filter safety, (6) telemetry &
logging hygiene, (7) run-as elevation & startup hooks.

## Modes

Pick the mode that matches the calling context. The mechanics are similar — what differs is *when* you run, what you consult, and how you format the output.

### Mode: `design` (used by iFacto.SolutionDesigner)

**Goal:** identify security concerns BEFORE code exists, and codify them as constraints in the instruction document.

1. Read the feature description / JIRA / draft design
2. For each of the 7 security categories, decide: applicable or not?
3. For each applicable category, read the matching BCQuality security/privacy articles
   (custom layer first, then microsoft layer) IN FULL, including their `.good.al`/`.bad.al`
   samples, and derive the design constraints that must appear in the instruction document
   so the implementation will pass review
4. (Optional) assess higher-level architectural impact yourself (auth model, trust
   boundaries, data flow)
5. Output a **"Security Considerations" section** ready to paste into `App/Docs/Instructions/<KEY>.design.md`

**Output format (design mode):**
```markdown
## Security Considerations

### Applicable categories
- [x] 1. Secrets & credentials — feature stores API token
- [ ] 2. Permissions & entitlements — N/A (no new objects)
- [x] 3. Data classification — new fields capture customer email
- [x] 4. External communication — calls vendor REST API
- [ ] 5. Injection & filter safety — N/A
- [x] 6. Telemetry & logging — feature emits import telemetry
- [ ] 7. Run-as elevation & startup hooks — N/A

### Design constraints
1. API token MUST be `SecretText` stored via `IsolatedStorage` with `DataScope::Module` (microsoft/knowledge/security/secrettext-for-credentials.md)
2. New `Loyalty Email` field MUST use `DataClassification = EndUserIdentifiableInformation` (microsoft/knowledge/privacy)
3. All HTTP calls MUST use HTTPS; no certificate validation bypass (microsoft/knowledge/security/validate-user-configurable-urls.md)
4. Telemetry MUST exclude email/token; use business keys only (microsoft/knowledge/security/getlasterrortext-storage-is-privacy-not-security.md)

### Open questions
- Which scope for the token: Module (single tenant config) or Company (per-company)?
```

### Mode: `code` (used by iFacto.ALCoder)

**Goal:** make sure the right AL primitives are used WHILE the code is being written — not after.

1. Identify which of the 7 categories the current task touches (look at the design doc's Security Considerations section if present; otherwise infer from the task)
2. For each applicable category, read the matching BCQuality security/privacy articles (custom layer first, then microsoft layer) and their `.good.al` samples
3. Extract the concrete code patterns (e.g., the `SecretText` + `IsolatedStorage.SetEncrypted` pattern, the `DataClassification` value to pick, the `Permissions` entry to add)
4. Apply patterns as you write — the `.good.al` sample is the authoritative expression, the `.bad.al` sample is what reviewers will flag
5. After implementation, run `iFacto.al-build-validation` (diagnostics-only) — security-relevant rules in CodeCop / AppSourceCop / PerTenantExtensionCop become evidence

**Output format (code mode):** inline guidance as you implement — no standalone report. State which patterns you applied:
```
🔒 Applied iFacto security patterns:
- Category 1 (secrets): API key stored via IsolatedStorage.SetEncrypted, DataScope::Module
- Category 3 (data classification): "Loyalty Email" = EndUserIdentifiableInformation
- Category 4 (HTTP): HTTPS only, SecretText for Authorization header
```

### Mode: `review` (used by iFacto.CodeReviewer)

**Goal:** validate finished code against iFacto security standards. Produce a pass/fail report. Critical findings block merge.

1. Determine review scope (changed files on current branch, or user-supplied file list)
2. Follow `iFacto.al-build-validation` skill in diagnostics-only mode to collect CodeCop / AppSourceCop / PerTenantExtensionCop output (some security issues are flagged by rulesets)
3. Invoke the **`al-code-review`** skill from the installed BCQuality plugin (Claude Code: `bcquality:al-code-review`) with the goal `"security review of the changed AL code"` — its dispatch runs the `al-security-review` and `al-privacy-review` leaf skills, which source security knowledge across ALL enabled layers (microsoft, community, and iFacto's custom rules)
4. Map each finding to one of the 7 iFacto categories via its `references[]` knowledge-file path, and categorize as Critical / High / Advisory with line references and exact corrections
5. Consolidate into the report below

**Output format (review mode):**
```markdown
## 🔒 AL Security Review

### Files reviewed
- {list}

### Per-category verdict (BCQuality security knowledge)
- ✅/❌ 1. Secrets & credentials: {detail with line refs + knowledge-file reference}

### Agent findings (self-review pass, outside the knowledge base)
- {al-code-review findings tagged `from-sub-skill: "agent"`, plus anything you spotted yourself}

### 🚨 Critical (block merge)
- {all Critical findings}

### ⚠️ High (fix before release)
- {all High findings}

### 💡 Advisory
- {all Advisory findings}

### Verdict
Security: ✅ APPROVED / ❌ CHANGES REQUIRED
```

## Important

- **This skill is NOT a replacement for the `iFacto.company-guidelines` skill** — it runs alongside it, focused on security
- **In `review` mode, Critical findings are blocking** — same severity as company guideline violations
- **In `design` mode, output is markdown to insert into the instruction doc** — not a standalone deliverable
- **In `code` mode, output is inline guidance** — the skill influences the code being written, no separate report
- **Always cite the knowledge file** — never invent security rules ad hoc; cite the BCQuality article path and the category number
- **Hand off if scope is wrong** — if a "security review" actually needs a full code review, defer to the agent's full `iFacto.code-review` + `al-code-review` pass and only contribute the security categories
