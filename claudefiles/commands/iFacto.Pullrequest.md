# Pull Request Documentation

Creates comprehensive pull request documentation with 5 mandatory sections.

## Step 1: JIRA Validation (MANDATORY FIRST)
1. Validate JIRA issue key is provided — **STOP and ask if missing** (NEVER fabricate)
2. Retrieve issue via `mcp-server-atlassian-jira/jira_get` → `/rest/api/3/issue/{KEY}`
3. Extract: summary, description, acceptance criteria
4. Compare PR changes to requirements: ✅ met / ⚠️ partial / ❌ not met / 🔍 scope creep
5. **Get user confirmation before proceeding**

## Step 2: Documentation Conventions
- Follow the `iFacto.documentation-generation` skill for PR documentation structure, writing style, and changelog format.

## Step 3: Change Detection
- Detect uncommitted changes + branch-specific commits (since branch created from main/master) — **these are the only files in scope**
- Run `ms-dynamics-smb.al/al_symbolsearch` scoped to the changed files only to build an accurate object inventory
- Follow the `iFacto.al-build-validation` skill (diagnostics-only) to capture build status
- If NO test files found: flag as missing automated tests — **NEVER fabricate test content**

## Step 4: Automated Test Run (MANDATORY GATE — SaaS sandbox)

On a SaaS sandbox, **every** test codeunit in the workspace runs green on the code as it is now, before the code review starts. **A failing test → no review, no PR.**

### 4.0 Decide from launch.json — never from the developer's word
Read `.vscode/launch.json` in the AL project root and apply the `iFacto.bc-saas-test-runner` skill's Step 1 table:
- **No AL app** (6.0) → skip. `## Testing` carries `🧪 Automated tests: not applicable — no AL app`.
- **A configuration with `"environmentType": "Sandbox"`** → the gate applies: 4.1 to 4.3.
- **OnPrem only** (`"server"` / `"serverInstance"`, no Sandbox configuration) → skip, ask nothing. `## Testing` carries `🧪 Automated tests: not run by the PR flow — OnPrem environment`.
- **QA configuration, Production only, or no launch.json** in a repository with an AL app → **STOP.** Report the skill's hard-stop message. Never treat a missing launch.json as OnPrem, and never pick another environment.

### 4.1 Publish, then run them all
1. Publish the app and the test app as they are now to the sandbox (`iFacto.al-build-validation` skill). A publish that fails → **STOP** with the error. Objects owned by a foreign DEV extension → the `iFacto.sandbox-switch` skill, then publish again.
2. Collect **every** test codeunit in the workspace: every `.al` file with `Subtype = Test` (any casing), with its ID and name — not only the ones this change touched.
3. Run each one with the `iFacto.bc-saas-test-runner` skill, all methods (no `--testmethods`). Do not ask which codeunits to run.
4. No test codeunit in the workspace → nothing to run; continue (Step 3 already flags the missing tests).

### 4.2 Hard stop on any failure
- **Every method passes** → continue with Step 5.
- **Any FAIL or ERROR** → **STOP.** Show the full results with the error messages. Run no code review, generate no PR description, create no PR. Tell the developer to fix the code or the test and re-run `/iFacto.Pullrequest`. Do not offer to continue anyway, and do not skip, disable or rewrite a test to get past the gate.
- **The run cannot complete** (`al` CLI missing, authentication fails after `--nocache`, codeunit not found on the server) → **STOP** with the reason. A run that did not complete is not a pass.
- **Running as a subagent**: a subagent cannot publish or run tests. End the run and report to the caller that Step 4 must run in the developer's session.

### 4.3 In the PR
`## Testing` carries one line after the attestation: `🧪 Automated tests: {n} test codeunits, {p} passed, 0 failed — sandbox {environmentName}`.

## Step 5: Code Review (MANDATORY GATE)

Every PR goes through `/iFacto.CodeReview` before it is created: the devleads' rulebook, BCQuality's `al-code-review` and the iFacto security review over the Step 3 scope. **No review → no PR.**

### 5.1 Run it yourself — never ask, never skip
1. Start the **`iFacto.CodeReviewer`** agent yourself with the `Agent` tool, in **local mode** (current branch against its target plus uncommitted changes). Do not ask whether to run it, and do not ask the developer to run it.
2. A review from earlier in the session, or one the developer says they ran, does not count — review the code as it is now.
3. **Running as a subagent** (e.g. inside `iFacto.Documentation`): agents never nest. End the run and report to the caller that the code review must run first; the caller runs `iFacto.CodeReviewer` and restarts `/iFacto.Pullrequest` with the result.

### 5.2 Act on the recommendation
Show the developer the full report, then:
- **`approve`** → continue with Step 6.
- **`fix`** → fix the findings first (the developer, or `iFacto.ALCoder` when they say **fix them**), then re-run Step 3, Step 4 (the tests) and this step. A finding the developer deliberately keeps is listed in the PR description under `## Assessment` with the developer's reason — never dropped silently.
- **`block`** or **`split`** → **STOP.** Generate no PR description and create no PR. Report the blocking findings, or the proposed split, and tell the developer to re-run `/iFacto.Pullrequest` once it is resolved.
- The review fails to run (missing toolset, error) → **STOP** with the reason from the agent's report. A failed review is not an `approve`.

### 5.3 In the PR
`## Assessment` carries one line: `🔍 Code review: {recommendation} — {n} findings fixed, {m} kept (see below)`.

## Step 6: Functional Test Attestation (MANDATORY GATE)

The developer must personally confirm that the change was **functionally tested in their own environment** and vouch for it. Automated tests and a clean build do not replace this. **No attestation → no PR** — in a repository with an AL app (6.0).

### 6.0 Only for a repository with an AL app
The attestation is about running the change in Business Central. It applies whenever the repository holds an AL app: an `app.json` anywhere in it — tracked (`git ls-files "*app.json"`, `App/` and `Test/` in the usual layout), not yet added, or in a submodule.
- **An AL app exists** → the attestation is mandatory: 6.1 to 6.5, with or without a `.vscode/launch.json`. launch.json only proposes the environment URL (6.3); without a matching configuration the developer gives it.
- **No AL app** (no `app.json` anywhere in the repository) → there is nothing to run in Business Central — BCCompanyGuidelines, for instance, holds the skills themselves, not customer customisations. Skip 6.1 to 6.5 and ask nothing. `## Testing` starts with this line instead of the attestation, and Step 9 posts no attestation comment:

> ℹ️ **Functional test attestation: not applicable** — this repository holds no AL app (no `app.json`).

- **Read the repository, never take the developer's word for it.** "No need to ask" in a repository with an `app.json` does not skip the questions, and neither does a missing or moved launch.json.

### 6.1 Resolve the developer's name — never guess it
1. Jira: `mcp-server-atlassian-jira/jira_get` → `/rest/api/3/myself` → `displayName`
2. No Jira (or the call fails): `git config user.name`
3. Show the name in the question below so the developer can correct it

### 6.2 Ask — after showing the Jira acceptance criteria (Step 1) and the changed objects (Step 3)
Ask these three questions and wait for the answers:
1. *"Have you functionally tested this change in your own environment, and do you vouch that it was actually tested? (yes/no) — recorded in the name of **{name}**."*
2. *"In which environment, and what is its URL?"* (e.g. sandbox name, Docker container, OnPrem test DB). Propose the URL from `.vscode/launch.json` when a configuration matches the environment, and let the developer confirm or correct it — see 6.3.
3. *"What did you test?"* (one line, the scenarios you ran)

### 6.3 Environment URL — derive or ask, never invent
The URL lets the reviewer and the Jira reporter open the environment the change was tested in.
- **SaaS** (`"environmentType": "Sandbox"`): `https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/{tenant}/{environmentName}` — leave out `{tenant}` when the configuration has none; URL-encode the environment name (a space becomes `%20`).
- **Docker / OnPrem** (`"server"` + `"serverInstance"`): `{server}/{serverInstance}/` (e.g. `http://bcserver/BC/`).
- No matching configuration (the developer tested somewhere else): ask the developer for the URL.
- Never guess a tenant, host or environment name. The developer has no URL to give (e.g. a local container only they can reach) → record `not available` with the reason they give.

### 6.4 Rules
- **Only an explicit "yes" to question 1, asked at this gate, counts.** An earlier remark such as *"create the PR, it's tested"* is not an attestation — still ask.
- **NEVER answer on the developer's behalf** and never pre-fill "yes". A passing test run or build is not an attestation either.
- **"No", "partially", "not yet", or an evasive answer → STOP.** Generate no PR description and create no PR. Tell the developer to test first and re-run `/iFacto.Pullrequest`.
- Questions 2 and 3 need a concrete answer — "yes" or "everything" is not one. Ask again once; still vague → STOP.
- **Running as a subagent** (no channel to the developer): end the run and report to the caller that the attestation is required. Never assume it.

### 6.5 Attestation text (fixed wording — reuse verbatim in Step 7 and Step 9)
Use the developer's name, today's date (`YYYY-MM-DD`) and their answers. Do not refer to the developer as he or she; the wording below uses the name only:

> ✅ **Functional test confirmed** — On {date}, {name} confirmed that this change was functionally tested in their own environment.
> - Environment: {environment}
> - Environment URL: {url}
> - Tested: {scope}

`{url}` is the confirmed URL from 6.3 as a clickable link — markdown `[{url}]({url})` in the PR description, an ADF link mark in Jira — or `not available ({reason})`.

The attestation is always in **English**, like the rest of the PR. If the developer answers questions 2 or 3 in another language, translate the answer to English without adding, dropping or softening anything, and show the translated text to the developer before using it.

## Step 7: Generate PR Description
**Format restrictions:**
- ✅ Headings, bullet lists, emoticons, bold text
- ❌ NO code blocks, NO tables with pipes
- **HARD LIMIT: 3800 characters maximum**
- **Language: English only**: title, every section, and the Jira comments in Step 9. Never mix languages, even when the conversation with the developer is in Dutch.

**Structure:**
```
# [Emoticon] [JIRA-ISSUE]: [Title]
## Summary
## Changes
## Testing  ← starts with the Step 6 attestation text (or the 6.0 not-applicable line)
## Deployment
## Assessment (star ratings as list)
---
Commit info
```

The attestation text from Step 6 — or the not-applicable line of 6.0 — is the **first item** of `## Testing`, verbatim. It counts toward the 3800-character limit — shorten other sections, never the attestation.

## Step 8: Create PR via Azure REST API
**NEVER use `az repos pr create`** — use REST API via `az rest`.

### Encoding Rules (CRITICAL — prevents corruption of emojis and special chars)

**Windows (PowerShell):**
1. Build a hashtable with `title`, `description`, `sourceRefName`, `targetRefName`
2. Convert to JSON: `$json = $body | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 5`
3. Write to temp file **without BOM**: `[System.IO.File]::WriteAllText($tmpFile, $json, [System.Text.UTF8Encoding]::new($false))`
4. POST: `az rest --method POST --uri "https://dev.azure.com/{org}/{project}/_apis/git/repositories/{repoId}/pullrequests?api-version=7.1" --headers "Content-Type=application/json" --body "@$tmpFile"`
5. Clean up: `Remove-Item $tmpFile -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue`

**macOS / Linux (bash/zsh):**
1. Use `python3 -c` to generate the JSON file (handles all escaping safely):
   `python3 -c "import json,sys; json.dump({'title':sys.argv[1],'description':sys.argv[2],'sourceRefName':sys.argv[3],'targetRefName':sys.argv[4]}, open(sys.argv[5],'w'), ensure_ascii=False)" "$TITLE" "$DESC" "$SOURCE" "$TARGET" "$TMPFILE"`
2. POST: `az rest --method post --uri "..." --headers "Content-Type=application/json" --body @"$TMPFILE"`
3. Clean up: `rm -f "$TMPFILE"`

**NEVER use:**
- PowerShell `Set-Content -Encoding UTF8` (adds BOM on PS5)
- Here-strings with emojis directly interpolated
- `echo` or `Write-Output` piped to file (encoding varies by shell)

### Authentication failure
If `az rest` returns 401/403 → tell the user: "Azure CLI token expired. Run `az login` to re-authenticate, then retry."

### Fallback
If `az rest` fails for ANY other reason (encoding error, network, unexpected response):
1. Inform the user: "REST API failed: [error]. Please check your Azure CLI authentication and network."
2. Suggest the user retry with `az login` followed by the same `az rest` command
3. Do NOT use any MCP-based Azure DevOps tools — always use Azure CLI (`az devops`, `az repos`, `az rest`)

## Step 9: Update JIRA Issue
If JIRA was validated:
1. Add a comment with PR link + description (excluding Deployment and Assessment sections).
2. When Step 6 applied (6.0): add the Step 6 attestation text as a **separate comment** with the PR link, so it stands on its own in the issue history. It carries the environment URL; keep it a working link after the ADF conversion.
- Convert markdown to Atlassian Document Format (ADF)
- If the description comment fails: log the error but don't fail PR creation
- If the **attestation comment** fails: the PR stays, but report the failure explicitly to the developer and hand over the attestation text to paste into Jira manually — never just log it

No Jira (e.g. tooling repositories): the attestation lives in the PR description only.

## Step 10: Approval and Merge Boundaries (MANDATORY)

Creating the PR is where your authority ends. Approval is a **second pair of eyes** — a control you are not part of.

### NEVER approve a PR authored by the user
- **NEVER cast an approve vote** (`vote: 10`) on a pull request the user created, and never approve on their behalf.
- This holds **even when the branch policy allows it**. Azure DevOps reporting `creatorVoteCounts=True` on the "Minimum number of reviewers" or "Required reviewers" policy is an administrative default, **not** authorization. A policy that permits self-approval does not make it acceptable — a self-approved PR defeats the entire purpose of the review.
- The approval must come from another member of the reviewer group configured on the repository (typically a `PR Approvers` group).
- Do not offer self-approval as an option for the user to decline. Report the state and name who can approve.

### NEVER bypass a blocking branch policy
- No `bypassPolicy` / `bypassReason` on completion, no autocomplete set to dodge a pending check, no force-push to sidestep a failed gate.
- A blocking policy that has not passed is a **STOP**, not an obstacle to route around.

### "Review and merge" does NOT include approving
Read *"review and merge"* as: **prepare everything so the merge can happen the moment a real reviewer approves.**
1. ✅ The code review of Step 5 (`/iFacto.CodeReview`: the devleads' rulebook, BCQuality's `al-code-review`, the security review) has run and its findings are fixed — that is the "review". Push fixes after PR creation → run Step 4 and the review again
2. ✅ Watch the blocking build and report its result
3. ✅ Push any fixes **immediately** — a push invalidates existing approvals, so fix before someone votes, never after
4. ⛔ **STOP** — state plainly that the merge waits on an approver, and offer to draft the request to one
5. ✅ Complete the merge only **after** someone else has approved

### Reporting the blocker
Read the real state before claiming what blocks the merge:
- Reviewer votes: `GET /_apis/git/repositories/{repoId}/pullrequests/{prId}?api-version=7.1` → `reviewers[].vote` (`0` = no vote, `10` = approved)
- Policy state: `GET /_apis/policy/evaluations?artifactId=vstfs:///CodeReview/CodeReviewId/{projectId}%2f{prId}&api-version=7.1-preview.1`

Report which policies are pending and who must vote — never infer approval state from the fact that a merge is technically possible.

## 5 Mandatory Documentation Sections
1. **JIRA Integration** — link, summary, business context
2. **Code Changes** — what changed, why, how
3. **Testing** — functional test attestation (Step 6) first, or the 6.0 not-applicable line, then the Step 4 test-run line, other automated tests, manual procedures, edge cases (⚠️ WARNING if no automated tests)
4. **Setup Guide** — prerequisites, steps, configuration
5. **Architecture Review** — honest 1-5 star ratings: Code Architecture, Code Quality, Performance, Maintainability, Extensibility

## Quality Standards
- Under 3800 characters (verify before creating PR)
- No placeholder/simulated content
- Accurate test state representation
- On a SaaS sandbox: every test codeunit passed on the final code (Step 4); a failing test means no PR
- Code review (Step 5) run on the final code, recommendation `approve` or every `fix` finding fixed or listed with a reason
- Functional test attestation present in the PR (and in Jira when a Jira issue exists) — confirmed by the developer, never by the agent; in a repository without an AL app, the 6.0 not-applicable line instead
- Honest architecture ratings (not everything is 5 stars)
